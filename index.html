      <p>I remember while growing up that David Beckham was a football masterclass. Everyone was talking about him. He used to play for Manchester United Football Club the. While admiring Beckham, I began supporting Manchester United as well and been a loyal fan since. I also support England national football team for the same reason and still do. Regardless to say, David Beckham had a big impact in my football fan following, so I atleast owe it to him to make a tribute page. </p>
